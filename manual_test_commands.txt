# Manual Test Script for EditClass and DeleteClass Commands
# Run these commands in the application to verify functionality
# Expected: All tests should pass with appropriate success/error messages

# 1. First, add some test classes
addclass Math101
addclass Physics201
addclass Chemistry301
addclass Biology401
addclass Advanced Math

# 2. Test EditClass - Successful case
# Should rename Math101 to Mathematics101
editclass o/Math101 c/Mathematics101

# 3. Test EditClass - Non-existent class (should show error)
editclass o/NonExistentClass c/NewName

# 4. Test EditClass - Duplicate class name (should show error)
editclass o/Physics201 c/Chemistry301

# 5. Test EditClass with spaces in name (CRITICAL TEST)
# Should successfully rename class with spaces in name
editclass o/Advanced Math c/Honors Mathematics

# 6. Test EditClass with spaces in both names
editclass o/Honors Mathematics c/AP Calculus

# 7. Test DeleteClass - Successful case
# Should delete Chemistry301
deleteclass Chemistry301

# 8. Test DeleteClass - Non-existent class (should show error)
deleteclass NonExistentClass

# 9. Test DeleteClass with class that was renamed
deleteclass Mathematics101

# 10. Test DeleteClass with spaces in name
deleteclass AP Calculus

# 11. Verify final state with listclasses
listclasses
